Description: This system is fit for stores that handle delivery of goods from concealed inventory or inventory systems under high revision from the store sellers and managers, it distributes the whole operation from the sale of their goods into different stages to handle the client order, inventory confirmation, order payment and order delivery. 

 

 

Step 1: Client Order 

A client request on the store from either a catalog on the reception, or a set of products on display, specifying quantity and specific product details if required or available, at this point while the system can tell beforehand if the requested products and quantity are available, it is still pending from confirmation on the next step, meanwhile, a collection order is generated in the system 

 

Step 2: Order Recollection 

Employees of the store gets the new collection order, and starts collecting the specified goods, at this point all material depending on modification (like from a roll of material) will not be altered but confirmed in quantity, inventory is not deducted at this point but reserved, if a specified order does not meet the available inventory, this will be reported into the order and the client will be queried if proceeding with the amount available or discarding it from the order. Once the collection and needed adjustment on the orders are made, a payment request is created, a tag is provided to the client, and the client can proceed into the payment area. 

 

Step 3: Payment 

The client provides the payment request tag and the payment area will ask for the requested payment, if the client for some reason cannot pay at the moment, the client can ask for it to be reserved and the order will be available for N amount of time, or cancelled and the payment order is closed and reserved inventory will be released back into available, otherwise the client pays and a delivery order is generated, the client will keep the same token previously provided for delivery 

 

Step 4 – Delivery 

The employees commit the order and any inventory depending on material modifications (such as part of a rolled material) will be performed while unitarian inventory will be taken directly, inventory reserved will be finally deducted, all goods are delivered to the client upon providing the token into the delivery area. All leftovers from that order is sent to the inventory management to set them back into inventory.
